It's about insertion sort. Everytime find a val that is smaller that the front node, scan from head to insert the smaller node.

My problem:
lack of using List. I know the steps but not sure how to write it.

C++ Solution:
ListNode* insertionSortList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy -> next = head;
        ListNode *pre = dummy, *cur = head;
        while (cur) {
            if ((cur -> next) && (cur -> next -> val < cur -> val)) {
                while ((pre -> next) && (pre -> next -> val < cur -> next -> val)) {
                    pre = pre -> next;
                }
                ListNode* temp = pre -> next;
                pre -> next = cur -> next;
                cur -> next = cur -> next -> next;
                pre -> next -> next = temp;
                pre = dummy;
            }
            else {
                cur = cur -> next;
            }
        }
        return dummy -> next;
